# Cah Tani App Using Flutter

Cah Tani is designed as a platform aimed at facilitating communication between the government and farmers. This application offers various outstanding features, including agricultural consultations, market price checks, weather monitoring, and reporting.

The agricultural consultation feature enables farmers to communicate directly with authorities, obtain advice, and exchange information related to agriculture. With the market price check feature, farmers can monitor fluctuations in agricultural product prices in the market, helping them make better decisions regarding sales and distribution.

Furthermore, the weather monitoring feature allows farmers to keep track of the latest weather forecasts, providing them with the necessary insights for more effective agricultural planning. Lastly, the reporting feature enables users to easily report issues or specific situations, such as pest attacks or emergencies, to the authorities.

With the use of Flutter, I strive to create a responsive and enjoyable user interface while maintaining data security and user comfort. Cah Tani is expected to be a valuable tool for both farmers and the government, helping to improve productivity and well-being in the agricultural sector.
